# Nutrient Timing

## Timing of Nutrients

Carbohydrates provide the most immediate energy source, protein helps build and repair muscle, and fats help to regulate hormones in addition to producing energy for extended bouts of exercise.



During exercise, on average, the body stores enough glycogen for about 90 to 120 minutes of endurance exercise

As exercise demands are placed on the body, muscle glycogen stores are continuously depleted. 

When most of the muscle glycogen stores have been used up and the body is trying to convert other forms of stored energy \(lean tissue and fat\) to glucose, as glucose is the required **substrate**. 

This typically starts to happen around 60 minutes of continuous exercise, without any **exogenous** carbohydrate replenishment.

| ATP-PC\* | Various tissues | 5 |
| Carbohydrate | Blood glucose | 80 |
|  | Liver glycogen | 400 |
|  | Muscle glycogen | 1500 |
| Fat | Serum free fatty acids | 7 |
|  | Serum triglycerides | 75 |
