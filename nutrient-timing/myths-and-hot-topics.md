# Myths and Hot Topics

### Is It Possible to Build Muscle and Lose Fat Simultaneously?

Yes，Increasing protein intake while in a negative energy balance can help preserve muscle.

Those subjects who ate double the RDA of protein \(1.6 grams protein/kilogram body weight\) and exercised were able to lose fat while preserving lean tissue.

Building muscle requires increased strength training and calories to aid in the replenishment and repair of muscles.

In young, recreationally active men and women, this study observed an advantage of consuming **low-fat milk** with **resistance exercise** in promoting **lean mass gains** both acutely and over time in conjunction with **fat-mass loss,** despite participants being in a positive energy balance.



### Carbohydrate Periodization

Carbohydrate periodization involves manipulating carbohydrate intake on a day-to-day or even a meal-to-meal basis. Low- to moderate- to high-carbohydrate meals are used to alter the availability of glucose in a proceeding training session.

carbohydrates --&gt;  free fatty acids --&gt;  muscle glycogen stores.

high-fat diet:  Improvement in the body’s ability to oxidize free fatty acids throughout exercise, it also showed a decrease in the body’s ability to oxidize carbohydrates.





Carbohydrate Periodization

| **Scenario** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Fasted Training | Waking up in the morning and exercising in a fasted state – The studies on this method are still inconclusive. |
| Recover Low | This method is where a client restricts carbohydrates in the post-exercise period with the intention of enhancing pathways for fatty-acid oxidation. |
| Sleep Low, Train Low | In this method, athletes perform an evening training session, restrict carbohydrates during overnight recovery, and then complete a fasted training session the following morning. The total time with reduced muscle glycogen is between 12 to 14 hours. Using this technique for 1 to 3 weeks showed improved endurance efficiency. |
| Twice-A-Day Training | Athletes complete a morning session to deplete muscle glycogen and follow the day up with a reduced carbohydrate intake, so the second exercise session is with reduced muscle glycogen. |

## Anabolic Window

The anabolic window refers to a period of time following exercise in which nutrients such as protein and carbohydrates can be used to maximize muscle growth and glycogen replenishment.

* How long does the post-workout window last for maximizing muscle growth? This window of time was thought to be within 30 to 45 minutes after exercise, but up to 1 to 2 hours after is when protein synthesis happens most effectively 
* How long does the post-workout window last for maximizing glycogen replenishment? Based on data from Ivy and colleagues, was that the suggestion to refuel immediately post-exercise was to replenish glycogen as rapidly as possible. The theory that glycogen repletion is maximized when carbohydrates are fed soon after a workout 
* How much carbohydrate and protein should be consumed during this period? There is no clear indication



### Breakfast - The Most Important Meal of the Day?

Research tells us breakfast consumption shows improvement in behavior, cognition, concentration, and school performance for the children
