# Portion Sizes

### Serving Size vs. Portion Size

A _portion_ is the amount of food or food product that an individual chooses to put on their plate or consume in a sitting. 

The _serving_ _size_ for a food or food product is typically a specific quantity that serves as a reference amount for the nutrition content and value of that food. 

An individualâ€™s portion _may be more or less than the standard serving size_ for a food item, depending on various factors such as their needs, the type of food being consumed, the eating occasion, and other components of the meal in question.

### Portion Distortion

These rising portion sizes may have contributed to an increase in average caloric consumption for each individual likely due to the fact that when presented with larger amounts of food, people tend to eat more.

Social-media platforms are another area in which food portions may be exaggerated.

Images of oatmeal and smoothie bowls, toast slathered with peanut butter, pancake stacks with drizzles of syrup, and salads garnished with multiple toppings can all _appear_ to be healthy and appetizing.
