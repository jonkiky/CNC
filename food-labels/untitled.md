# Food Labels

Most packaged food items are **required** by the **FDA** to display a label that identifies the name of the product, the quantity of product in the package, the name and address of the manufacturer, the ingredient list, the nutrition facts label, and **a statement on any common allergens in the food.**

### History

The nutrition facts label is required to display the following information:                                       

* The number of **servings per container**
* **Serving size**
* **Total calories** per serving
* Amount of **total fat** per serving \(in grams\), **saturated fat** \(in grams\), and **trans fat** \(in grams\)
* **Cholesterol** \(in milligrams\)
* **Sodium** \(in milligrams\)
* **Total carbohydrates** \(in grams\)
* **Dietary fiber** \(in grams\)
* **Total sugars** and **added** **sugars** \(in grams\)
* **Protein** \(in grams\)
* **Amounts** and the **Percent Daily Value** for the following vitamins and minerals: vitamin D \(in micrograms\), calcium \(in milligrams\), iron \(in milligrams\), and potassium \(in milligrams\)



The prior/standard nutrition facts label required vitamins A and C to be listed but these are no longer required on the new version of the label.

 **Percent Daily Value** for the listed nutrients. The Percent Daily Value indicates how much one serving of the food item contributes toward the recommended daily value for that particular nutrient \(fat, carbohydrates, vitamin D, etc.\) _based on a 2000-calorie diet._ 

The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics \(AND\) recommends that consumers generally choose products that provide 5% or less of total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium and 20% or more for fiber, vitamins, and minerals

Percent daily values are provided for added sugar as current guidelines recommend limiting added sugar to no more than 10% of daily calories.

### Food Labels Outside the United States

in the UK and EU, **it is provided for a standard 100 grams of a dry product or 100 or 200 milliliters of a liquid product.** For comparison, a hundred grams of a dry food product and a hundred milliliters of liquid are both approximately 3 1/2 ounces.



In the EU, nutrition labels will also provide a percent **Reference Intake** \(%RI\) on the nutrition facts label, which serves a similar purpose as the percent daily values on a U.S. nutrition facts label

#### Color Coding on UK and EU Food Labels

![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2021-02-07-at-9.14.36-pm.png)

It is  required to list all ingredients in a packaged food product in _decreasing order of prevalence,_

In the EU and UK, manufacturers are also required to list the percentage of an ingredient in a product if it is mentioned in the name of the product, highlighted or noted on the food label, and/or an ingredient that is typically associated with the product \(Gov.UK, n.d.\).



Encourage clients to look at the ingredient list for products they buy and to select foods with five or less ingredients \(not including added vitamins and minerals\) and ingredients that they recognize.
