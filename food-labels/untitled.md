# Food Labels

Most packaged food items are **required** by the **FDA** to display a label that identifies the name of the product, the quantity of product in the package, the name and address of the manufacturer, the ingredient list, the nutrition facts label, and **a statement on any common allergens in the food.**

The nutrition facts label is required to display the following information:                                       

* The number of **servings per container**
* **Serving size**
* **Total calories** per serving
* Amount of **total fat** per serving \(in grams\), **saturated fat** \(in grams\), and **trans fat** \(in grams\)
* **Cholesterol** \(in milligrams\)
* **Sodium** \(in milligrams\)
* **Total carbohydrates** \(in grams\)
* **Dietary fiber** \(in grams\)
* **Total sugars** and **added** **sugars** \(in grams\)
* **Protein** \(in grams\)
* **Amounts** and the **Percent Daily Value** for the following vitamins and minerals: vitamin D \(in micrograms\), calcium \(in milligrams\), iron \(in milligrams\), and potassium \(in milligrams\)



The prior/standard nutrition facts label required vitamins A and C to be listed but these are no longer required on the new version of the label.

 **Percent Daily Value** for the listed nutrients. The Percent Daily Value indicates how much one serving of the food item contributes toward the recommended daily value for that particular nutrient \(fat, carbohydrates, vitamin D, etc.\) _based on a 2000-calorie diet._
