# Carbohydrate Introduction

Carbohydrates are often referred to as **sugars** and **starches**, or as simple and complex carbohydrates.

Except for **lactose** \(**milk sugar\)** and **glycogen** \(the **storage form of carbohydrates in the body\)**, all carbohydrates are plant-derived.

## Carbohydrate Structure

scientific classifications:

 **monosaccharides** -&gt; single sugar units

**disaccharides** -&gt; paired sugar units, 

 **polysaccharides**, which represent longer sugar unit chains. 

 **oligosaccharides**, also exists, containing 3 to 10 sugar units. Polysaccharides and oligosaccharides are known as complex carbohydrates. 

Once absorbed, carbohydrates can be used immediately as a **source of fuel** or can be **stored as glycogen** in specific cells. In fact, the largest storage depots for carbohydrates \(glycogen\) are the **muscle and liver cells**.



### Monosaccharides

**Glucose** \(sometimes also referred to as dextrin or dextrose\), **fructose**, and **galactose** represent the three nutritionally important monosaccharides to humans.

**galactose** is only present in dairy products

### Disaccharides

* **Sucrose** is comprised of one glucose molecule joined with one fructose molecule. Examples include cane sugar, brown sugar, and date sugar. Sucrose contributes as a primary **sugar in most fruits**.
* **Lactose** is comprised of one glucose molecule joined with one galactose molecule. **It is only found in dairy products**.
* **Maltose** is comprised of two glucose molecules. Examples include **corn syrup, brown rice syrup, and molasses.**

#### Added Sugars

Added sugars are those not naturally occurring in food groups

are either monosaccharides or disaccharides that contain glucose, fructose, or galactose \(**Table:** **Added Sugars**\).
