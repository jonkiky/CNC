# Functions

The primary role of dietary carbohydrates is to provide **energy** for the body. Any **excess** carbohydrates not used for immediate energy production can be stored as **glycogen within the muscle and liver.**

The physiological pathway of fat metabolism involves a carbohydrate byproduct for complete metabolism.

degraded fat fragments are converted to **ketones** and metabolized differently

body can produce glucose from certain non-carbohydrate sources, including specific amino acids \(via **gluconeogenesis**\) that are almost exclusively derived from muscle tissue. 

The body can also make glucose from fatty acids, if needed, particularly when consuming a high-fat, very-low carbohydrate diet
