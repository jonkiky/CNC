# Accommodating In A Dietary Program

The recommended dietary allowance \(**RDA**\) for carbohydrates for adults aged **19** years and older is set at **130** grams per day



the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range \(**AMDR**\) for carbohydrates is set at **45 to 65%** of the total caloric intake daily, which might be at least double the RDA. **270 to 390 grams** a day based on four calories equals one gram of carbohydrates. 

he overall goal for healthy eating is to reduce the total percentage of a**dded sugars** from 13% to under 10% of total caloric intake



The American Heart Association \(AHA\) and Center for Science in the Public Interest \(CSPI\) make more conservative recommendations, suggesting the following:

* AHA – limit of 6 added teaspoons \(women\) and 9 added teaspoons \(men\) \(AHA, 2016\)
* CSPI – limit 100 kcal or 6 ½ teaspoons \(women\) and 150 kcal or 9 ½ teaspoons \(men\)  \(CSPI, 2015\)
