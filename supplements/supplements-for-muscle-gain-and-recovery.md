# Supplements for Muscle Gain and Recovery

Protein intake greater than the recommended dietary allowance \(RDA\) of 0.8 gram/kilogram/day of body weight has been shown to help individuals performing resistance-training exercise maintain **protein balance**, build muscle mass, and improve body compositionthere is general consensus that **protein, creatine monohydrate, and essential amino acids** are supported by strong evidence for enhancing resistance-training-induced outcomes, including strength and muscle hypertrophy.

### Creatine Monohydrate

Creatine monohydrate is synthesized endogenously in the **liver** and **kidneys** **from amino acids** and is stored primarily in muscle tissue.

 Its role is to regenerate intracellular **ATP** stores via the **phosphocreatine** system during **high-intensity activity**.



**Greater gains** in muscle tissue seem to be a result of **superior training adaptations** due to i**ncreased workload capacity at high intensities**.





Creatine Sources

| **Source \(8 oz serving\)** | **Creatine Content** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Beef \(lean\) | 1.5 to 2.5 g |
| Pork | 1.5 to 2.5 g |
| Herring | 2.0 to 4.0 g |
| Salmon | 1.5 to 2.5 g |
| Milk | 0.05 g |





 Only side effect \(which is typically one of the desired side effects\) being **weight gain** due to increases in **water retention** and **muscle mass**

### Protein

The ingestion of high-quality protein stimulates **muscle protein synthesis \(MPS\)** and the effect is enhanced with **resistance** training**.**

\*\*\*\*

Protein intake greater than the recommended dietary allowance \(RDA\) of **0.8 gram/kilogram/day** of body weight has been shown to help individuals performing resistance-training exercise maintain **protein balance**, build muscle mass, and improve body composition



These increases were n**ot further enhanced** with daily protein intakes greater than **1.62 gram/kilogram** of body weight

Older individuals **did not appear to benefit** from training-induced increases and muscle protein supplementation



however, the average dose among older subjects was **20 grams/day.** It has been shown that **higher** **dosages of up to 40 grams** post-exercise are needed to achieve muscle protein synthesis rates similar to younger counterparts, likely due to the **anabolic resistance** among older individuals 

“**anabolic resistance**,” which is defined as the reduced ability of skeletal muscle to increase protein synthesis in response to amino acids and protein, insulin, or exercise



The International Society of Sports Nutrition \(**ISSN**\) recommends a daily protein intake of **1.4 to 2.0** grams/kilograms of body weight to build and maintain muscle tissue for most exercisers



This **did not yield** greater increases in lean mass compared to **2.2 grams/kilograms/day.**

After resistance exercise, **skeletal muscle synthetic rates r**emain elevated for up to **24 hours** and, although the consumption of protein immediately \(1 hour\) after training or competition **may not enhance** hypertrophy **if total daily intakes are met,** doing so may support recovery and subsequent training and performance.



the post-workout period offers an opportunity to consume a **high-quality protein dose** to help reach daily targets, enhance MPS, and potentially benefit continuous intense training.



Athletes and exercisers interested in **optimizing muscle protein synthesis** to maximize gains in lean tissue may benefit from **per-meal protein doses of 0.40 to 0.55 gram/kilogram**, consumed across at least **four** **meals** to reach total daily intakes of 1.6 to 2.2 grams/kilograms.



Protein Supplement Leucine Content

| **Protein Supplement Type** | **% Leucine Content** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Whey | 11% |
| Casein | 9.3% |
| Eggs | 8.5% |
| Soy Isolate | 8% |
| Peas | 8% |
| Wheat | 7% |
| Brown Rice Isolate | 8% |



### Whey

Whey and casein are derived from bovine milk, comprising **20% and 80%** respectively of the **protein component of milk.**

Whey protein concentrate is the liquid fraction of milk and is typically about 80% protein with small amounts of carbohydrates, fat, and **lactose**.

Whey protein hydrolysate contains shorter amino acid chains \(peptides\), which are formed by adding enzymes to either whey concentrate or isolate, purportedly enhancing digestion and absorption.



#### Casein Protein

it contains **less leucine** and **is insoluble in acid,** forming clots in the stomach acid, thereby leading to slower digestion and absorption.

the research on pre-sleep protein ingestion and its effect on **MPS**, strength, and muscle mass has been conducted with casein. The optimal protein types and dosages have yet to be established



#### Plant Protein

Plant-based protein supplements are growing in popularity and are often **composed of one or more protein sources from soy, peas, rice, and others.**

 be inferior to whey and casein due to lower leucine content, fewer essential amino acids, and lower **bioavailability** 

**bioavailability:** The extent to which an ingredient, food, or other substance is absorbed by the body.

I**n theory,** a plant-based protein source rich in EAAs and leucine with high bioavailability would stimulate MPS and enhance the response to resistance exercise.

**whey and pea protein groups** experiencing similar and significant improvements in muscle. 

**Protein** supplementation provides a **viable means** of optimizing the muscle synthetic response over 24 hours with benefits appearing greater with whey and casein, which are abundant in **leucine** and contain the full spectrum of **EAAs** required to synthesize muscle tissue.



* A pre-bedtime protein dose of 30 to 40 grams may help maximize MPS during sleeping hours.

### 

### Essential Amino Acids

It is well-established that complete protein sources, which contain the greatest amounts of **EAAs**, are the **most effective at stimulating muscle protein synthesis** with a synergistic effect occurring with **resistance** **training**.

**EAAs** are an effective means to stimulate MPS and can potentially aid in preserving muscle mass and enhancing resistance training outcomes during aging.

branched chain amino acids \(**BCAAs**\)





Essential Amino Acids

| Leucine | Isoleucine | Valine |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Histidine | Lysine | Methionine |
| Phenylalanine | Threonine  | Tryptophan |

Some studies have investigated the potential value of **EAAs** to reduce perceived muscle **soreness**, decrease **markers** of muscle **damage**, or help **maintain force** production and, thus, support ongoing **high-quality training sessions**.

**EAA or BCAA** ingestion with adequate leucine may serve as a viable nutritional strategy to maximize MPS throughout the day **among young and older** individuals and may be particularly beneficial with lower protein intakes while restricting calories to promote fat loss, minimize the loss of lean tissue, and support recovery from intense training.



Consuming **6 to 15 grams** of essential amino acids **EAA** with **1.7 to 3.5 grams** of **leucine** may maximize MPS and reduce muscle **soreness**.

Adequate leucine **\(1.7 to 3.5 grams\)** and all **EAAs** are required to stimulate muscle protein synthesis and build muscle tissue.
