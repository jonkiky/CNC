**5 -** Proper supplementation to support **body** **composition**, training, and **performance**

**4 -** Meeting **micronutrient** needs based on nutritional gaps in the diet

**3 -** Tailoring **carbohydrate** and fat amounts and timing based on client preferences and energy needs for training and competition

**2 -** Meeting daily **protein** requirements for the desired outcomes

**1 -** Daily **energy** needs according to the client’s goal and demands of the activity



This model implies that daily energy needs, protein intake, and essential nutrient requirements are of higher priority than supplements, including **ergogenic aids** because they have a greater impact on the individual’s body composition or performance goals compared to supplements.

**ergogenic aids ：** Something that improves either physical or mental performance.



### Regulation of Dietary Supplements

I**n the United States,** the regulation of supplements is dictated by the Dietary Supplement and Health and Education **Act** \(**DSHEA**\) of 1994 \(U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2018\). Under the provision of the DSHEA, dietary supplements, which include herbs, botanicals, vitamins, minerals, and other ingredients, are regulated as food products.



**over-the-counter medication and prescription drugs** are subject to premarket testing and approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration **\(FDA\)**

\*\*\*\*

Manufacturers of dietary supplements are responsible for adopting **current good manufacturing practices \(cGMPs\),**which are standards and guidelines to ensure supplements are made properly.

Manufacturers are also obligated to make accurate label claims and are prohibited from marketing supplements to prevent, treat, cure, or diagnose a disease.

label claims for supplements **do not have to be approved** by the Federal Trade Commission \(FTC\) or the FDA prior to their sale and marketing.

the FDA performs annual **inspections of randomly** selected manufacturing sites to assess compliance with cGMPs.

In the 2016 FDA Inspection Report of nearly 5**00 manufacturing facilities**, infractions were found at nearly **2/3 of the facilities**
