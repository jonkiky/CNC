# Motivational Interviewing Strategies



1. Express empathy through reflective listening. 
2. Help clients identify discrepancies between their values or goals and their behavior. 
3. Support self-efficacy. 
4. Avoid arguments.
5. Adjust to client resistance.

### Express Empathy

Accurate empathy occurs when the coach uses **reflective listening** that clarifies and expresses an understanding of a person's own experiences and goals and personal meaning for those goals.

**fundamental attribution error**. This error occurs when a person's behavior is attributed to “the way they are” rather than to external factors.

If coach begin thinking the client is making poor health choices because they are “lazy” or “lack motivation,” the spirit of collaboration between the coach and the client will be lost.

**Unconditional positive regard** is the opposite of the fundamental attribution error. The coach needs to understand the client's feelings, as well as the meaning of their unhealthy behavior, without blaming, judging, or criticizing them.



### Identify Discrepancies

Think of the way discrepancies drive behavior as part of a **feedback loop**. People have an **ideal version of themselves,** often called the _ideal comparator_. People take in information about their current self and, if a discrepancy is perceived between where they currently are and their ideal comparator, they perform behaviors to **reduce this discrepancy.** 

A goal of MI is to have clients voice their reasons for changing by helping them identify a discrepancy between their ideal comparator and their current status quo. 

 coaches can use several strategies. One of these strategies, a **values exploration**, may help a client see the differences in how they are behaving now with how they would like to perceive themselves.

### Supporting Self-Efficacy

**Self-efficacy** is a person’s confidence that they can successfully execute behaviors required to produce outcomes.

An individual's perception of their self-efficacy, in relation to the challenge of the behavior, tells the client whether the pursuit of a goal is attainable or out of reach

**Enhancing self-efficacy** can be done using four methods: **performance accomplishments,** **hearing of other's success in similar situations** \(vicarious experience\), **a coach’s encouragement** \(verbal persuasion\), and even **emotions such as stress** \(physiological states\)



Sources of Self-Efficacy

| **Source** | **Example** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Performance accomplishments** | Provide a client with a chance to make an attainable change. For example, if the client typically eats out 4 nights per week, celebrate their success when they drop down to 1 night per week. |
| **Vicarious experience** | Provide examples of other clients who have been in the current client’s shoes. Give examples of what they did to achieve their goals. |
| **Verbal persuasion** | If a client is not sure that they have the ability to do a certain task, remind them of times in the past where they have successfully made changes. Maybe the client is not sure that they have time to do food preparation but they also said the same thing about fitting in exercise. Remind them that when they scheduled effectively they were able to exercise more. |
| **Physiological states** | Create a positive coaching relationship that mitigates nervousness and anxiety. If a client feels unsure about a certain behavior, either provide empathetic listening to help the client see a solution or suggest a different behavior that does not elicit negative emotions. |

One technique used in MI to support self-efficacy is **affirmation**. An affirmation is a positive statement about the client’s character that acknowledges their efforts

An affirmation might sound like this:

#### You did a great job making time to do food preparation this week. It looks like you really prioritized it!

Affirmations are not just about giving praise for a job done well; the articulation of why the coach believes the client is successful \(prioritized\) is impactful.

**affirmations** can empower clients to believe in their abilities, improve self-confidence, support change, and decrease defensiveness while encouraging persistence



### Avoid Arguments and Adjust to Client Resistance

A Nutrition Coach cannot succeed when arguing with a client. Arguments can make coaches defensive and defend the status quo.

The opposite of resistance is change talk. Change talk describes movement toward change, whereas resistance describes movement away.
