# Motivational Interviewing Strategies



1. Express empathy through reflective listening. 
2. Help clients identify discrepancies between their values or goals and their behavior. 
3. Support self-efficacy. 
4. Avoid arguments.
5. Adjust to client resistance.

### Express Empathy

Accurate empathy occurs when the coach uses **reflective listening** that clarifies and expresses an understanding of a person's own experiences and goals and personal meaning for those goals.

**fundamental attribution error**. This error occurs when a person's behavior is attributed to “the way they are” rather than to external factors.

If coach begin thinking the client is making poor health choices because they are “lazy” or “lack motivation,” the spirit of collaboration between the coach and the client will be lost.

**Unconditional positive regard** is the opposite of the fundamental attribution error. The coach needs to understand the client's feelings, as well as the meaning of their unhealthy behavior, without blaming, judging, or criticizing them.



### Identify Discrepancies

Think of the way discrepancies drive behavior as part of a **feedback loop**. People have an **ideal version of themselves,** often called the _ideal comparator_. People take in information about their current self and, if a discrepancy is perceived between where they currently are and their ideal comparator, they perform behaviors to **reduce this discrepancy.** 

A goal of MI is to have clients voice their reasons for changing by helping them identify a discrepancy between their ideal comparator and their current status quo. 

 coaches can use several strategies. One of these strategies, a values exploration, may help a client see the differences in how they are behaving now with how they would like to perceive themselves.
