# Motivational Foundations



Motivation Example Comparison

| **Motivation** | **Example** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Amotivation | I will not eat healthy because I do not want to eat healthy. |
| Extrinsic  | I will eat healthy because, if I do not, I could face health problems. |
| Intrinsic | I will eat healthy because I really enjoy knowing that I am fueling my body with the best nutrients possible.  |

Motivational interviewing is a client-centered method for enhancing intrinsic motivation to change by exploring and resolving ambivalence.

**Self-Determination Theory \(SDT\)** is a motivational theory that is closely aligned with MI \(Patrick & Williams, 2012\). SDT postulates that motivation can lie anywhere on a continuum from **amotivation**, to **extrinsic motivation**, to **intrinsic motivation**.

Motivational regulation varies along a continuum and is reflective of the level to which a behavior is integrated into an individual’s values or identity. When behaviors have been **internalized** and are reflective of the self, yet are still extrinsic, they are considered autonomous and extrinsically motivated.



**Controlled Motives:** Those with motives who feel outside or internal pressure to do certain behaviors.

**Autonomous Motives:** Behaviors that are enacted with a sense of volition and choice – autonomously motivated people want to do the behavior.

Motivational Regulation Examples

| **Motives** | **Motivational Regulation** | **Example** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Controlled Motives** | External | Losing weight because there is a weight-loss challenge at work and the winning team gets a prize |
| Introjected | Losing weight because of the guilt of being overweight |  |
| **Autonomous Motives** | Identified | The client believes that achieving and maintaining a healthy weight is personally important. |
| Integrated | Losing weight because being healthy and fit is consistent with the client's other health goals \(e.g., running a half marathon\) |  |
