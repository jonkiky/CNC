Many synthetic pesticides have been linked to **cancer** \(Goodson, et al., 2015\), hormone **disruption** \(Vandenberg et al., 2012[\)](https://paperpile.com/c/Cv3Z5O/flkX), and **neurological disorders** \(Burns, McIntosh, Mink, Jurek, & Li, 2013\). **Organic** produce has **four-fold** **lower** levels of pesticide residues than conventional produce \(Barański et al., 2014; Smith-Spangler et al., 2012\).

**A lower pesticide exposure** through eating organic produce can be considered a health benefit, especially for pregnant women, **infants, and children** who are in developmental stages where pesticide exposure can have profound developmental effects

controlled trials have demonstrated that switching from conventional to organic produce significantly reduces biomarkers of pesticide exposure in as little as 5 to 7 days in adults and children
