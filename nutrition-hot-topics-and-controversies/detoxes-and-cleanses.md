# DETOXES AND CLEANSES

Usually, a combination of highly restrictive dieting and expensive supplementation for no more than a couple weeks, **detox and cleansing programs** claim to purify the body of ill-defined toxins that are sapping people’s health. 

There is **little to no** research on detox programs, with their perceived benefits being the simple result of extreme calorie restriction

The human body has the natural ability to detoxify. It does it on a daily basis to stay alive and healthy.

When discussing detoxification with the client, emphasis should be placed on supporting the body’s natural ability to detoxify itself, which can be done by eating **nutrient-dense foods** rich in **vitamins, minerals, and amino acids** that the liver requires to accomplish this goal.

Considering that many clients will be interested in weight loss, it is important to understand that the body accumulate toxins and toxicants in the environment to various extents depending on diet, lifestyle, and environment.

This includes things like heavy metals \(e.g., arsenic\), pesticides \(e.g., glyphosate\), and pollutants.

While **weight loss ultimately benefits** the health of many people who are overweight or obese, some negative effects may be realized during the weight-loss process itself as **toxins and toxicants are released from fat cells** 

**Rapid weight loss seems to cause the greatest toxic burden**

Many clients may be impatient and want to lose weight rapidly. This can be motivating for them but it can also reduce adherence to the weight-loss plan if the **toxic load released from fat cells is overwhelming**

### Juicing

Juicing is a popular activity by many health enthusiasts and dieters that involves extracting the juice from fresh fruits or vegetables. 

one could opt for blending fruits and vegetables rather than juicing them, so as to retain the entire food.

Juices retain many of the nutrients from the whole food but **not all of them, missing out on the fiber \(pulp\) and some phytochemicals**

Nutrition Coaches also need to be mindful of what is being juiced. Fruit juices taste great and are rich in phytochemicals but they are also rich in **sugars and calories**

phytochemicals **:** any of various biologically active compounds found in plants.

Vegetables are more nutrient-dense and lower in sugars but they also contain more **anti-nutrients** that become concentrated in the juice. For example, some people have given themselves **kidney** **disease** by consuming oxalate-rich juices

juicing should be **incorporated** into a whole-foods diet, **not used a substitute** for it.
