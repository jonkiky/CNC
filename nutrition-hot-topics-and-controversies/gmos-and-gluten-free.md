# GMOs and Gluten-Free

## Genetically Modified Organisms

**Genetically modified organisms** **\(GMOs\)** are defined by the World Health Organization \(2014\) as “organisms \(i.e. plants, animals or microorganisms\) in which the genetic material \(DNA\) has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating and/or natural recombination.”

Additionally, certified organic foods in the United States are not allowed to contain GMOs.

### Potential Risks of GMOs

Direct effects are best demonstrated by the ways in which genetic modification expresses itself, not always in ways that can be anticipated.

the expression of allergenic proteins and changes in metabolite concentrations, including toxic ones, that result from poorly understood regulatory pathways in plants in response to genetic modification

Indirect effects come from how GMOs are used in agricultural practices. Currently, most genetically modified crops are aimed at providing the plant with inborn resistance to either pests or pesticides or both.
