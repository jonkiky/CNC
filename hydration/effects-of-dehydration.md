# Effects of Dehydration

## Hydration and Heat Illness

Regulation of **body** **temperature** during exercise is influenced by total-body water levels in multiple ways.

Increased body water can also reduce heat generation related to elevated cardiovascular strain

Some heat can be dissipated from the body via movement of the blood to the skin if the external environment is cooler than the body’s internal environment

The majority of thermoregulation attributed to body water in hot conditions comes from the production and evaporation of sweat.

### Sweating

Several elements determine sweat evaporation rate.

  **heat**. Higher temperatures increase the rate of sweat evaporation. 

**humidity**. Environments with lower humidity increase the rate of sweat evaporation, 

 **convection**. For nonaquatic activities, convection describes how air movement or lack of air movement increases or decreases sweat evaporation

Convection can be caused by the wind or by the client’s movement against air, which can be significant in activities
