# Developing Hydration Strategies

## Defining Hydration Status

Dehydration for clients is often caused by excessive sweating or lack of fluid intake.

Measurement of plasma osmolality or sodium concentration requires a blood draw and expensive analyzers to determine a clinical definition of hydration status.

### Sweat-Loss Assessment

Sweat-loss assessment allows the Nutrition Coach to determine if their clients do indeed experience major fluid deficits and if any intervention is needed.

The American College of Sports Medicine \(Sawka et al., 2007\) recommends that **fluid intake should not exceed sweat-loss volume** and a **fluid deficit should be limited to less than 2% of body mass.**

\*\*\*\*

There is ongoing debate concerning whether a 2% loss in body mass from dehydration is a valid indicator of performance impairment



**Exercise Associated Hyponatremia \(EAH\):** A potentially serious medical condition in which the plasma sodium falls below 135 mmol/L, usually the result of fluid intake greatly exceeding sweat losses during prolonged exercise.

EAH is a potentially deadly medical condition most commonly caused by fluid intake that greatly exceeds sweat loss, which dilutes ECF sodium levels. -- leads to weakness, cramping, vomiting, disorientation, or confusion.
