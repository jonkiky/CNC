# Developing Hydration Strategies

## Defining Hydration Status

Dehydration for clients is often caused by excessive sweating or lack of fluid intake.

Measurement of plasma osmolality or sodium concentration requires a blood draw and expensive analyzers to determine a clinical definition of hydration status.

### Sweat-Loss Assessment

Sweat-loss assessment allows the Nutrition Coach to determine if their clients do indeed experience major fluid deficits and if any intervention is needed.

The American College of Sports Medicine \(Sawka et al., 2007\) recommends that **fluid intake should not exceed sweat-loss volume** and a **fluid deficit should be limited to less than 2% of body mass.**

\*\*\*\*

There is ongoing debate concerning whether a 2% loss in body mass from dehydration is a valid indicator of performance impairment



**Exercise Associated Hyponatremia \(EAH\):** A potentially serious medical condition in which the plasma sodium falls below 135 mmol/L, usually the result of fluid intake greatly exceeding sweat losses during prolonged exercise.

EAH is a potentially deadly medical condition most commonly caused by fluid intake that greatly exceeds sweat loss, which dilutes ECF sodium levels. -- leads to weakness, cramping, vomiting, disorientation, or confusion. 





## Pre-Exercise Hydration Status Assessment

### Thirst and Body Mass as Indicators of Hydration Status

it has been proposed that athletes record their morning body weight after making voids over a 3-day period and use a 1% decrease from the 3-day body-mass average as a marker of hypohydration



thirst sensation and change in body mass are likely great indicators of pre-exercise hydration status if fluid intake after the previous exercise bout is highly insufficient, b

### Urinalysis as Indicator of Hydration Status

Urine osmolality, color, and specific gravity are also used to gauge real-time hydration status.

Urine-specific gravity may be an option for Nutrition Coaches looking for a more objective way to determine if clients are adequately rehydrating between training 

**Urine-specific gravity:** A measurement that represents the ratio of solutes in the urine versus distilled water. : which the pathway of light is bent \(or refracted\) after traveling through a liquid in comparison to light passing through water that has no solute content.

a USG exceeding 1.020 has been used as a dichotomous hydrated/dehydrated measure.

## Fluid Intake During and Between Training

Nutrition Coaches should only **intercede** when **intervention** is actually **needed**

A simple recommendation is that if fluids are freely accessible during training and sweat losses will be less than about **3%** of body mass, no formal hydration advice concerning beverage consumption is needed during exercise.



### Fluid Intake During Exercise



fluid consumption can take place without difficulty

The athlete should also practice their competitive fluid-intake routine strategy during training to determine if fluid consumption volume or beverage type will result in gastrointestinal distress.
