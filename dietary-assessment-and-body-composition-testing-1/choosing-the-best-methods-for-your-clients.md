# Choosing the Best Methods for your Clients

### Interpreting Changes in Body Composition and Tracking Progress

Once information is collected about how the client’s body is changing over time, interpret these values and communicate the information to the client. This will allow both parties to understand more about the effects the client’s nutrition and exercise habits are having on his or her body.

**First**, realize that each method has some inherent level of error. 

In addition to interpreting results with caution, it is important for the client’s body composition to be assessed the exact same way each time.

In terms of the assessment method, **do not compare results** from **different** **devices** as the body composition results of the client will vary based on the device used.

It is **not critical** that the most technologically advanced method is used. However, it is critical that the same method is used **consistently** over time. 

That is, it is desirable for the client to **have not had anything to eat or drink** in the previous 8+ hours as well as having performed **no exercise** or physical activity other than daily activities.

Due to the inherent errors in each method of body assessment, it may be beneficial to perform several different simple techniques

In addition to the methods discussed here, some clients find it useful to take periodic progress pictures to visualize their progress. Whether or not a client shares them, this can be a way to record the results of the mirror test.

The Nutrition Coach should keep organized records of any dietary and body-composition information collected for a particular client.

Regardless of the amount of time or resources available, being as consistent as possible will increase the confidence in the body-composition information obtained from clients. 

### Communication and Sensitivity

While the Nutrition Coach has the responsibility to guide clients toward a healthier lifestyle, this should be done with sensitivity.

Some clients will be ready and willing to change habits in order to work toward their health goals but others may be more resistant. The Nutrition Coach will need to develop the expertise and knowledge of clients to be able to determine **how** **much** each individual client can **handle** at once and how to communicate the recommended changes.

It is important to recognize that some individuals may feel somewhat **uncomfortable** with having their body composition assessed and discussed.
