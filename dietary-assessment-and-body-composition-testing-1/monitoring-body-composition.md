# Monitoring Body Composition

**Body composition** refers to all the separate compartments making up the human body. The composition of the body is one of several important factors to consider when evaluating an individual’s health and wellness. 

All methods of body composition attempt to divide the body into separate parts that have importance for the health and proper functioning of the body.

**Body mass index \(BMI\)**, which is calculated as an individual’s weight in kilograms divided by their height in meters squared, is another commonly used metric that considers all body weight equal

 **2-compartment models**  typically, these parts are fat mass and fat-free mass.

 **3-compartment model**  typically, these parts are fat mass, water, and everything

**4-Compartment Model**  these parts are fat mass, water, bone, and everything else

Body volume can be obtained by underwater weighing or air displacement plethysmography \(ADP\); water can be estimated by bioelectrical impedance analysis \(BIA\) and bone can be estimated using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry \(DXA\).

While the 4-compartment model boasts impressive accuracy, it is typically unavailable outside of research environments.



#### Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis \(BIA\)

**Bioelectrical impedance analysis** **\(BIA\)** is a technology that estimates body composition by calculating the fluid content of an individual’s body using small currents of electricity. produces a 2-compartment model to split the body into fat mass and fat-free mass. **inexpensive**

These include bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy \(BIS\) and electrical impedance myography \(EIM\). While these devices have traditionally not been commonly available to the general population, some affordable devices are now being produced and marketed to individual consumers.
