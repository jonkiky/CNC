# Micronutrient Application

The availability of a nutrient for assimilation into the body from food is known as **bioavailability**. 

The extent to which an ingredient, food, or other substance is absorbed by the body.



**Iron** can be used as a use case to highlight some of the factors that influence bioavailability.

**heme iron**,  **animal sources,** is absorbed more efficiently \(10 to 35% absorption\) when compared to **nonheme** iron \(2 to 20% absorption\), which is found in **plants**

Even among those broader categories, there are substantially different rates of absorption:

in heme iron sources, about 10% of iron is absorbed from fish, while 20% is absorbed from veal muscle. In non-heme sources, roughly 2% of iron is absorbed from black beans, while 7% is absorbed from soybeans

Absorption of **iron** can be **enhanced** by co-ingestion of **vitamin C**, especially non-heme iron.

absorption of **iron** is substantially **reduced** when co-ingested with **phytates**,

### Micronutrient Programming

#### Covering the Food Spectrum

Pragmatically speaking, achieving complete macro- and micronutrition in the developed world is best achieved by eating a well-balanced diet: several servings of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats or fish

#### Multivitamin/Mineral vs. Individual Nutrients

Using single nutrients can impart the ability to target and correct single nutrient deficiencies quicker and more effectively.

Micronutrients often work synergistically and the doses found in multivitamins make it more difficult to develop micronutrient toxicities, especially from fat-soluble vitamins.

#### People Restricting Energy & Other Populations of Concern for Deficiencies

There is also some concern for nutrient deficiencies among people with celiac disease. Those with celiac disease must restrict gluten-containing foods in their diet. Further,



Reference Intake Descriptions

| **Dietary Reference Intake Label** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Estimated Average Requirement \(EAR\)** | A nutrient intake value that is estimated to meet the requirement of **half** the healthy individuals in a group |
| **Recommended Dietary Allowance \(RDA\)** | The average daily dietary intake level that is sufficient to meet the nutrient requirement of **nearly all \(97 to 98%\)** healthy individuals in a group |
| **Adequate Intake \(AI\)** | A value based on observed or experimentally determined **approximations** of nutrient intake by a group \(or groups\) of healthy people – used when an RDA cannot be determined |
| **Tolerable Upper Intake Level \(UL\)** | **The highest level of daily nutrient intake** that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects to almost all individuals in the general population – As intake increases above the UL, the risk of adverse effects increases. |
