# Supplements for Fat Loss

Weight-loss supplements, whether in pill, capsule, or powder form, often contain one or more ingredients that **stimulate** the **nervous** **system** and are routinely advertised as fat burners due to their impact on metabolism.

Commonly used stimulants include **caffeine**, **green tea extracts**, **ephedra**, **bitter orange**, and capsaicinoids and may be combined with herbs, other plant-derived ingredients, amino acids, and minerals.

### **Caffeine** \(1,3,7-trimethyl-xanthine\)

 **Source**:  coffee beans, kola nuts, guarana seeds, yerba mate, and tea leaves, and it is also synthesized in a lab as caffeine anhydrous.

**Effects**:  It stimulates the **nervous system** and has been shown to **modestly** **increase** daily energy expenditure, **decrease** energy **intake**, reduce perceived-effort-level of exercise, and improve feelings of energy and alertness \(Acheson et al., 2004; Harpaz, Tamir, Weinstein, & Weinstein, 2017\).

A meta-analysis of six well-designed studies revealed **caffeine-only and caffeine with catechins** from tea significantly increase 24-hour energy expenditure by **4.8 and 4.7%** respectively compared to the placebo.



sedentary women with higher dosages \(5 to 10 milligrams/kilograms\) consumed prior to moderate exercise, resulting in greater energy expenditure compared to exercise without caffeine

Caffeine appears to be a **viable** **weight-loss tool;** however, fat-burner supplements often include other ingredients, including green tea, capsaicin, bitter orange, and ephedra \(which is now banned in the United States\)

Green tea extracts, primarily EGCG, in combination with caffeine have been shown to increase metabolism and fat oxidation and to modestly boost weight loss and reduce waist circumference

**but adverse side effects**, including elevated heart rate, increased blood pressure, jitteriness, nervousness, and gastrointestinal distress, may occur and are more likely at higher doses \(&gt; 500 milligrams\) and among novel users



The American Medical Association recommends that teenagers limit daily intake of caffeine to **100 milligrams/day**

Adult intake of caffeine up to 400 to 500 milligrams per day appears safe in healthy individuals

### p-synephrine

The stimulants **p-synephrine**, the active ingredient extracted from bitter Seville oranges \(citrus aurantium\), and **ephedrine**, derived from a native Chinese plant \(**ma huang**\), are commonly included in weight-loss supplements

**Ephedra** was banned as an ingredient in dietary supplements in 2004 by the U.S.

P-synephrine is structurally similar to ephedrine and is often marketed as an ephedra-free fat-loss aid due to its apparent stimulatory effect on the central **nervous system, energy expenditure, and mild suppression of appetite**

### Capsaicin

Capsaicin is one of five naturally present capsaicinoids in **red chili peppers** and is purported to be a natural weight control due to its ability to stimulate thermogenesis, increase body temperature, and decrease food intake

administered **2.56 milligrams of capsaicin to 15 normal-weight** and overweight individuals before meals three times a day during a **25% caloric deficit** and observed a significant **increase in fat oxidation** over a 36-hour period.



**Capsaicin ingestion** prior to meals appears to have a modest impact on both sides of the energy-balance equation, potentially serving as a useful aid to help manage appetite and slightly increase daily expenditure. Capsaicin is considered safe when used in the amounts studied, with 4 milligrams/day resulting in reports of **gastrointestinal distress, elevated insulin levels, and lower HDL cholesterol levels among some study participants.**

Capsaicin may have a slight positive impact on energy expenditure, appetite, and food intake when consumed in **2- to 4-milligram doses before meals.**

### Starch/Fat Blockers and Other Common Weight Loss Ingredients

**Phaseolus** vulgaris, extracted from white kidney beans, **inhibits** the action of the **digestive enzyme** amylase, thus, interfering with the digestion of and absorption of carbohydrates and **potentially preventing absorption**

Daily dosages of Phaseolus vulgaris ranging from 500 to 3,000 milligrams for up to 12 weeks have been shown to modestly enhance weight loss

**Chitosan** is another blocker supplement manufactured from shellfish. It is marketed as a fat blocker due to its ability to prevent absorption of dietary fat by binding to it in the intestinal tract.

Other commonly used ingredients in weight-loss supplements include **conjugated linoleic acid \(CLA\), L-carnitine, chromium, green coffee bean extract, and hydroxycitric acid or HCA \(garcinia cambogia\),** all of which are either lacking in well-designed research or have shown virtually no impact on body weight \(Manore, 2012\).



### Meal-Replacement Formulas

The use of protein-rich shake formulas has been shown to be an effective strategy for reducing caloric intake and supporting weight loss and weight-loss maintenance

Supplements promoted as fat burners **have a limited impact on weight loss** with most ingredients lacking quality evidence. However, **the use of protein-rich meal replacements one to two times/day has been shown to improve weight-loss success, body composition, and maintenance of a healthy body weight.**
