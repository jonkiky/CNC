# Supplements for Fat Loss

Weight-loss supplements, whether in pill, capsule, or powder form, often contain one or more ingredients that **stimulate** the **nervous** **system** and are routinely advertised as fat burners due to their impact on metabolism.

Commonly used stimulants include **caffeine**, **green tea extracts**, **ephedra**, **bitter orange**, and capsaicinoids and may be combined with herbs, other plant-derived ingredients, amino acids, and minerals.

### **Caffeine** \(1,3,7-trimethyl-xanthine\)

 **Source**:  coffee beans, kola nuts, guarana seeds, yerba mate, and tea leaves, and it is also synthesized in a lab as caffeine anhydrous.

**Effects**:  It stimulates the **nervous system** and has been shown to **modestly** **increase** daily energy expenditure, **decrease** energy **intake**, reduce perceived-effort-level of exercise, and improve feelings of energy and alertness \(Acheson et al., 2004; Harpaz, Tamir, Weinstein, & Weinstein, 2017\).

A meta-analysis of six well-designed studies revealed **caffeine-only and caffeine with catechins** from tea significantly increase 24-hour energy expenditure by **4.8 and 4.7%** respectively compared to the placebo.



sedentary women with higher dosages \(5 to 10 milligrams/kilograms\) consumed prior to moderate exercise, resulting in greater energy expenditure compared to exercise without caffeine

Caffeine appears to be a **viable** **weight-loss tool;** however, fat-burner supplements often include other ingredients, including green tea, capsaicin, bitter orange, and ephedra \(which is now banned in the United States\)

Green tea extracts, primarily EGCG, in combination with caffeine have been shown to increase metabolism and fat oxidation and to modestly boost weight loss and reduce waist circumference

**but adverse side effects**, including elevated heart rate, increased blood pressure, jitteriness, nervousness, and gastrointestinal distress, may occur and are more likely at higher doses \(&gt; 500 milligrams\) and among novel users



The American Medical Association recommends that teenagers limit daily intake of caffeine to **100 milligrams/day**

### p-synephrine

The stimulants **p-synephrine**, the active ingredient extracted from bitter Seville oranges \(citrus aurantium\), and **ephedrine**, derived from a native Chinese plant \(**ma huang**\), are commonly included in weight-loss supplements

**Ephedra** was banned as an ingredient in dietary supplements in 2004 by the U.S.

P-synephrine is structurally similar to ephedrine and is often marketed as an ephedra-free fat-loss aid due to its apparent stimulatory effect on the central **nervous system, energy expenditure, and mild suppression of appetite**

### Capsaicin

Capsaicin is one of five naturally present capsaicinoids in red chili peppers and is purported to be a natural weight control due to its ability to stimulate thermogenesis, increase body temperature, and decrease food intake
