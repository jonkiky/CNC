# Diet Approaches Based on Food Choices and/or Restrictions

**Mediterranean Diet**

The Mediterranean diet was originally conceived based on observations of the good health experienced by populations living by the Mediterranean \(predominantly Greece, Italy, and Spain\).

When adherence to the diet is sufficiently high, it is also associated with decreased mortality.

Plant foods such as fresh vegetables, fruit, grains, and nuts make up the basis of the diet in addition to liberal use of **olive oil**. Fish, poultry, and dairy like **cheese** and **yogurt** are included in moderate amounts while **red meat consumption is low.**

Current evidence strongly supports the Mediterranean diet as a health-promoting diet.



#### Vegan Diet and Vegetarian Variations
