# Diet Approaches Based on Time Restrictions and/or Fasting

### Fasting and Time-Restricted Feeding

Fasting is achieved by consuming zero to minimal amounts of calories \(via food and caloric beverages\) for periods that can range from 12 hours to 3 weeks \(Longo & Mattson, 2014\).



There are various distinct iterations of a dietary approach based on intermittent fasting:

1. Alternate Day Fasting
2. 5:2 Diet
3. Time-Restricted Feeding \(TRF\)
4. Prolonged Fast \(several days of fasting done every several months\)

#### Alternate Day Fasting

Alternate day fasting is a protocol that is just as its name implies; the individual alternates between a day of fasting and a day of feeding \(typically ad libitum dieting\).

#### 5:2 Diet

The 5:2 diet derives its name from a description of the protocol: 2 fasting days and 5 feeding days per week. Calories can be consumed on the fasting days with a maximum of typically 500 kcal set for women and 600 kcal for men.



#### Time-Restricted Feeding

Time-restricted feeding is a term that has appeared in research to describe an eating approach where there are specific eating and fasting windows across the day. As an example, a common variant of intermittent fasting is a **16:8 fasting:feeding approach.** As the name suggests, in such a set-up the individual would fast for 16 hours in every 24-hour period, leaving a feeding window of eight hours .

Recent research has suggested such a 16:8 time-restricted feeding pattern may improve health markers and decrease body fat

Nutrition Coaches should never recommend a specific fasting strategy to clients. This information is only intended to educate clients who have expressed an interest in fasting so that they may make the best choice for themselves.
