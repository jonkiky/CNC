# Navigating Diets Introduction



Clients will often come to the Nutrition Coach with questions about popular diets or fad diets. The Nutrition Coach should be able to accurately and objectively discuss the merits of these approaches, leaving the client more informed and less susceptible to falling for nonevidence-based approaches.

Dietary approaches can vary based on several factors, including but not limited to the folllowing:

* Energy \(calorie\) control,  e.g., calorie counting, points-based commercial diets, or specific meal plans
* Macronutrient composition, e.g., low-carb, low-fat, ketogenic, or protein-sparing modified fast
* Food type/group choices and/or restriction, e.g., gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, paleo, clean eating, or Mediterranean
* Time-based restriction, e.g., fasting, time-restricted feeding, or cut-off times for meals/nutrients
* Degree of flexibility or rigidity of the dietary restraint



Remember to always refer clients to a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist \(RDN\) or medical doctor if they want specific, personalized diet guidance and recommendations.



one must understand the principles by which diets in general influence health and body composition, rather than relying on any given dietary method.
