# Diet Approaches Based on Macronutrient Composition

### Low-Energy Diets \(Low-Calorie Diets\)

Typically, low-energy diets will be of about 800 to 1,200 kilocalories per day \(kcal/d\).

Research has consistently shown clear improvements in health markers when overweight or obese patients lose body fat, even when those losses are moderate



Negative Effects of Low-Calorie Dieting and Rapid Weight Loss

| Increased risk of lean body mass loss, particularly in those who are already relatively lean |
| :--- |
| Decreased athletic performance |
| Lowered ability to recover from exercise |
| Increased hunger versus more moderate calorie reduction \(although not always the case\) |
| Decreased food options |
| Difficulty in consuming sufficient amount of micronutrients |



Losses in lean body mass \(e.g., muscle\) can be largely or almost entirely mitigated through the inclusion of high protein intake and resistance training
