# Social Eating, Traveling, and Dining at Home

**Eat lightly \(but do** _**not**_ **starve\) on the day of the party or event.** A more-practical strategy is to eat lightly but to have nourishing and nutrient-dense meals earlier in the day to avoid excess hunger later on.

Examples of some protein-based snacks are plain, low-fat Greek yogurt or cottage cheese, low-sodium deli meat, tuna, or a hard-boiled egg. If hungry prior to an event, having a small protein-based snack may help individuals avoid arriving at the event hungry and risk overeating.

**Contact the host ahead of time**

**Offer to bring a dish** 

**Set a drink limit ahead of time**.

**Monitor portions.**  One approach is to focus on vegetables and lean proteins for appetizers and then structure the main meal using the guidelines of the USDA My Plate or a Healthy Eating Template.



**Prioritize Foods.** 

**H**olidays and parties often include foods that are eaten on rare occasions \(i.e., turkey, stuffing, pumpkin pie, etc.\). Rather than indulging in every single item at a party or event, a healthier approach may be to select two or three dishes that seem particularly appealing and to enjoy moderate portions of those.

## Travel

### Prior to Traveling

Make a list of healthy, mostly non-perishable food items to pack such as nuts, fruit and nut protein bars, nut butters, and whole-grain crackers for snacks. If possible, pack the meals for the journey.

Before the next time you travel, research a few healthy restaurants and grocery stores at your destination. Having an idea of where to eat and shop on arrival can ease some of the pressure and anxiety over being able to make healthy choices while traveling.

visit a local grocery store to purchase fruit, breakfast options, and a few snacks

## Dining at Home

**Meal prep** can sound overwhelming, but it is not as labor-intensive, time-consuming, or complicated as it initially seems. Meal prep can be kept fairly simple depending on an individualâ€™s preferences and lifestyle. The basic idea behind meal prep is to prepare some or all meals or meal components in advance in order to **save time and energy during a busy week.**

\*\*\*\*

Some additional benefits of meal prep include the following:

* Having meals already prepared or ready-to-prepare, thereby, reducing the chance of ordering out or making less-healthy food choices
* Not having to worry about what to eat or prepare on multiple days of the week because the preparation has been done beforehand
* Having additional time to engage in other activities \(such as exercise, time with family, etc.\) during the week
