### Creatine Monohydrate

Creatine monohydrate, as previously described, is supported by hundreds of studies that not only demonstrate its ability to i**ncrease strength and muscle gain but also its performance-enhancing** effects for any activity during which the **phosphocreatine system is heavily taxed**.

**Performance improvements in endurance exercise are not as well-supported;** however, creatine may help **enhance glycogen synthesis** and aid in thermoregulation due to its ability to draw fluid into muscle



**Nine weeks** of creatine supplementation and resistance training in elite football players resulted in **significant differences in strength, anaerobic power and capacity, lean body mass, and body weight** compared to the placebo and control groups

**Short-term** use of creatine monohydrate at **20 grams/day,** divided into **5-gram dosages four times a day for 5 to 7 days**, can enhance anaerobic exercise capacity and performance. Continued use with a daily maintenance dose of **3 to 5 grams** may improve strength, power, and performance due to greater training adaptations.



### Caffeine

Caffeine is often included in **preworkout-type** supplements in the purified, anhydrous form.

Caffeine ingestion prior to intense exercise reduces rates of perceived exertion, lowers pain,

Among trained cyclists, with low \(**100 milligrams/1.5 grams/kilograms\)** and moderate \(**200 milligrams/2.9 milligrams/kilograms**\) dosages consumed during exercise, time trials were completed significantly faster

Among athletes who participate in team sports requiring repeated sprints over a prolonged period, **6 milligrams/kilograms** of caffeine consumed an hour before exercise trials resulted in 8.5% greater work performed and 7% higher peak power.  study on resistance exercise concluded **3 to 9 milligrams/kilograms** ingested 60 minutes prior to activity improves maximal strength.

**Side effects :** 

As noted, daily intakes of over 400 to 500 milligrams may cause side effects, including irritability, nausea, insomnia, and restlessness. Caffeine is contraindicated among those with heart disease, hypertension, thyroid disease, and anxiety and is not recommended during pregnancy and lactation.



### Beta Alanine

is a nonessential amino acid naturally present in animal meats and produced in the liver.

Performance improvements result from **less fatigue** during intense activity of short to moderate duration \(1 to 4 minutes\). 

The IOCâ€™s recommendation is based on weight \(about **65 milligrams/kilograms**\) to be ingested in doses of **0.8 to 1.7 grams every 3 to 4 hours for 10 to 12 weeks**, **noting** the potential for meaningful performance benefits **for continuous or intermittent activity** lasting 30 seconds to 10 minutes



Theoretically, supplementation would allow **resistance exercise** workloads to increase, leading to greater adaptations such as strength, power, and lean mass gain, **but this has yet to be determined.**

Skin tingling, a phenomenon known as paresthesia, is a reported side effect

### 

### Sodium Bicarbonate

Sodium bicarbonate, commonly known as baking soda, aids in **buffering the acidity** **in the blood** due to the production of hydrogen ions during sustained strenuous exercise,

The overall body of evidence indicates **pre-exercise dosages** ranging from **0.2 to 0.4 gram/kilogram** of body weight, which equates to 3 to 5 teaspoons of baking soda approximately **1 to 2.5 hours** before activity improves short-term, high-intensity exercise performance by approximately 2% with benefits **diminishing** **beyond 10 minutes**
