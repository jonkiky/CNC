# Programming Introduction

**Programming** is formally defined as the action or process of scheduling something. In the context of nutrition coaching, programming can be defined as the process or scheduling of a nutrition plan in which the plan is set into motion to achieve a specific goal.

Applying these principles can be achieved by employing seven defined, but integrated steps:

1. Set a goal.
2. Determine the total daily energy requirements adjusted for the goal.
3. Set the protein macronutrient target.
4. Set the fat macronutrient target.
5. Set the carbohydrate macronutrient target.
6. Individualize and convert numbers to food and habits.
7. Monitor, evaluate, and adjust. 

### Set a Goal

The first step in the programming process is to define the end outcome for the program.

#### Weight \(Fat\) Loss

While some people may set weight-loss goals based on previous body weight or an **arbitrary number**, a Nutrition Coach must understand what thresholds and targets can **improve client health while still being feasible to achieve.**
