# Seven Steps for Nutrition Programming

* 3 to 5 g/kg/day \(1.3 to 2.2 g/lbs/day\) for general population and athletes who partake in low-volume training or mostly skill-based training
* 5 to 8 g/kg/day \(2.2 to 3.6 g/lbs/day\) for athletes who partake in moderate-volume, high-intensity training – This can be defined as athletes engaging in 2 to 3 hours of training per day for 5 to 7 days per week.
* 8 to 10 g/kg/day \(3.6 to 4.5 g/lbs/day\) for athletes who partake in high-volume, endurance-based training – This can be defined as athletes engaging in 3 to 6 hours of training per day for 5 to 7 days per week.
* About 12 g/kg/day \(5.4 g/lbs/day\) for athletes who partake in very-high-volume, endurance-based training – This can be defined as athletes engaging in &gt; 6 hours of training per day for 5 to 7 days per week.

An individual’s TDEE, the total amount of calories expended in a given day, is comprised of three main components: **Basal Metabolic Rate \(BMR\)**, **Thermic Effect of Activity \(TEA\)**, and the **Thermic Effect of Food \(TEF\)**.   Note that Nonexercise Activity Thermogenesis \(NEAT\), or random acts of movement throughout the day ****besides structured exercise \(e.g., fidgeting, taking a shower, or walking to a parked car\), ****is considered an aspect of TEA

Once basal metabolic rate is determined, the next step is to multiply it by an activity factor



Activity Factor Adjustments

| **Level of Activity** | **Description of Activity** | **Activity Factor Adjustment** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Sedentary | Little or no exercise and a desk job | 1.2 |
| Lightly Active | Light exercise 1 to 3 days per week | 1.375 |
| Moderately Active | Moderate exercise 3 to 5 days per week | 1.55 |
| Very Active | Heavy exercise 6 to 7 days per week | 1.725 |
| Extremely Active | Very heavy exercise or a physical job or training twice per day | 1.9 |



Case Study:

Peter is a busy 40-year-old business executive. He weighs 100 kilograms \(220 pounds\) and is 6 feet tall \(182 centimeters\). He is moderately active, exercising about 4 days per week for 1 hour each session \(an activity factor of 1.55\). He wants to lose some weight and is willing to be on a 500-calorie deficit per day.

Calculate Peter’s TDEE using the Mifflin–St. Jeor equation:

* BMR = Male: 9.99 × weight \(kg\) + 6.25 x height \(cm\) – 4.92 × age + 5

**Answer:**

BMR = 9.99 × 100 \(kg\) + 6.25 × 182 cm – 4.92 × 40 + 5 = 1,944 calories

1,944 × 1.55 = 3,014 calories

**3,014 calories** = TDEE

Based on these assumptions, Peter should consume about 2,514 calories per day \(3,014 – 500\) to help him lose weight. He will round this down to **2,500** to keep things simple.

### Set the Protein Target

Daily protein targets should be set between 1.2 grams/kilogram and 2.2 grams/kilogram \(0.54 to 1.0 gram/pound\). 

For clients who fall into the _**general** population_ category, protein targets of 1.2 to 1.6 grams/kilogram \(0.54 to 0.7 grams/pound\) are appropriate. 

For **athletes** or individuals looking to maximize muscle growth and training adaptations, protein targets of 1.6 to 2.2 grams/kilograms \(0.7 to 1.0 gram/pound\) are appropriate. 

While protein targets can be set higher than this at 2.3 to 3.1 grams/kilograms to **preserve** **muscle** during periods of **caloric restriction**, these levels of protein do not augment muscle growth above 1.6 to 2.2 grams/kilograms.



### Set the Fat Target

Setting a daily fat target differs from protein in that it should be based on total calorie intake. The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range \(AMDR\) for adults is **20 to 35%.**  

Fat intake can increase above 35% if there is adequate fiber, micronutrient, and carbohydrate intake to allow for the appropriate level of workload for the client.

Case Study:

Peter, the business executive, has already determined his calorie and protein intake. His next step is to determine how many calories for fat he should eat. His Nutrition Coach recommends a modest fat intake of 30% based on Peter’s food preferences. Peter is sticking with a 2,500-calorie diet to help lose some weight. How many calories should he consume from fat each day?

**Answer:**

2,500 × 0.30 = **750 calories from fat per day**

750 / 9 calories per gram = **83 grams of fat per day**



### Set the Carbohydrate Target

Carbohydrate targets can be set based on the remaining calories left after protein and fat targets are established. The formula would look like this:

Carbohydrate target calories = total daily calories – protein calories – fat calories

Remember that carbohydrate needs will increase as training volume and intensity increase and that total daily fat calories as a percent will decrease concurrently.



* 3 to 5 g/kg/day \(1.3 to 2.2 g/lbs/day\) for **general** population and athletes who partake in low-volume training or mostly skill-based training
* 5 to 8 g/kg/day \(2.2 to 3.6 g/lbs/day\) for **athletes** who partake in **moderate**-volume, high-intensity training – This can be defined as athletes engaging in 2 to 3 hours of training per day for 5 to 7 days per week.
* 8 to 10 g/kg/day \(3.6 to 4.5 g/lbs/day\) for **athletes** who partake in **high**-volume, endurance-based training – This can be defined as athletes engaging in 3 to 6 hours of training per day for 5 to 7 days per week.
* About 12 g/kg/day \(5.4 g/lbs/day\) for **athletes** who partake in **very-high**-volume, endurance-based training – This can be defined as athletes engaging in &gt; 6 hours of training per day for 5 to 7 days per week.

Carbohydrate target calories = total daily calories – protein calories – fat calories

Carbohydrate target calories = 2,500 – 640 \(protein\) – 750 \(fat\) = 1,110

Carbohydrate target = **1,110 calories**

Carbohydrates in grams = 1,110 calories / 4 calories per gram = **278 grams of carbohydrate per day**
