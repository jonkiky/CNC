# Seven Steps for Nutrition Programming

An individual’s TDEE, the total amount of calories expended in a given day, is comprised of three main components: **Basal Metabolic Rate \(BMR\)**, **Thermic Effect of Activity \(TEA\)**, and the **Thermic Effect of Food \(TEF\)**.   Note that Nonexercise Activity Thermogenesis \(NEAT\), or random acts of movement throughout the day ****besides structured exercise \(e.g., fidgeting, taking a shower, or walking to a parked car\), ****is considered an aspect of TEA

Once basal metabolic rate is determined, the next step is to multiply it by an activity factor



Activity Factor Adjustments

| **Level of Activity** | **Description of Activity** | **Activity Factor Adjustment** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Sedentary | Little or no exercise and a desk job | 1.2 |
| Lightly Active | Light exercise 1 to 3 days per week | 1.375 |
| Moderately Active | Moderate exercise 3 to 5 days per week | 1.55 |
| Very Active | Heavy exercise 6 to 7 days per week | 1.725 |
| Extremely Active | Very heavy exercise or a physical job or training twice per day | 1.9 |



Case Study:

Peter is a busy 40-year-old business executive. He weighs 100 kilograms \(220 pounds\) and is 6 feet tall \(182 centimeters\). He is moderately active, exercising about 4 days per week for 1 hour each session \(an activity factor of 1.55\). He wants to lose some weight and is willing to be on a 500-calorie deficit per day.

Calculate Peter’s TDEE using the Mifflin–St. Jeor equation:

* BMR = Male: 9.99 × weight \(kg\) + 6.25 x height \(cm\) – 4.92 × age + 5

**Answer:**

BMR = 9.99 × 100 \(kg\) + 6.25 × 182 cm – 4.92 × 40 + 5 = 1,944 calories

1,944 × 1.55 = 3,014 calories

**3,014 calories** = TDEE

Based on these assumptions, Peter should consume about 2,514 calories per day \(3,014 – 500\) to help him lose weight. He will round this down to **2,500** to keep things simple.
