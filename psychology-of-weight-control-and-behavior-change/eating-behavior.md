### Disordered Eating

Patterns of abnormal eating behaviors that do not meet the criteria for diagnosis of an eating disorder.

A major underlying concern of disordered-eating behaviors is that they can manifest into an eating disorder, which can have serious health consequences up to and including death.



#### Triggers to Disordered Eating

There can be countless triggers to disordered eating that can range from the environment and situations to long-term **psychological** challenges.

Distress :The experience of negative feelings, such as anxiety, sorrow, or pain.

Depression: A mood disorder characterized by a persistent feeling of sadness and/or loss of interest in everyday life.

 **Anorexia nervosa**, **bulimia nervosa**, and **binge-eating disorder** can only be diagnosed by a qualified medical professional based on the DSM-V criteria

Anorexia Nervosa:  Eating disorder characterized by extremely low BMI.

Bulimia Nervosa: Eating disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by inappropriate compensatory behaviors, including purging, use of laxatives or diuretics, fasting, or excessive exercise to avoid weight gain.

Binge-Eating Disorder:  Eating disorder characterized by frequent consumption of an unusually large amount of food along with a feeling of loss of control and/or the inability to stop eating.

## Modifying the Eating Environment

By modifying how to approach the home environment, the work environment, and social gatherings, clients can successfully navigate situations that were once difficult. One shift that needs to be made is from **mindless eating** to **mindful eating** habits.

Eating without attention to or awareness of the food being consumed.

Paying attention to the food being eaten, acknowledging hunger and satiety signals, and adjusting food intake accordingly.
