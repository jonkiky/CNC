# The Science of Psychology

**Psychology** is the study of the mind and behavior.

Psychology is mainly based on **qualitative** inquiry, which relies on being able to observe _behaviors_ and assess individuals based on what is being said. 



**Quantitative** Research: Focuses on variables that can be directly measured and assessed.

**Qualitative** Research: Focuses on people in terms of how situations and experiences are perceived and how people interact and utilizes interviews and observations where the results are grouped together by themes that have emerged.

### The Desire to Change

Motivation can be both intrinsic and extrinsic in nature

Intrinsic motivation describes when people are motivated by an **internal drive** to be **competent** or **successful**, these people are fulfilled when they master a skill or behavior change.

Extrinsic motivation refers to being motivated by **rewards and recognition.**

## Communication

One of the keys to effective communication is conveying empathy. **Empathy** is when someone identifies with another person’s feelings, attitudes, or thoughts. 

To identify with others and show empathy, it is crucial to not be judgmental and to convey understanding.



**Conveying Empathy vs. Understanding**

| **Empathy \(relating to someone’s feelings\)** | **Understanding \(showing knowledge\)** |
| :--- | :--- |
| _I know it’s tough making decisions at the grocery store; with so many options it can be overwhelming. I’m going to give you some hints and tips to help you make good decisions._ | _What I hear you saying is you’re not sure how to identify the healthiest options while grocery shopping. Is that correct?_ |
| _I can imagine that you are very frustrated with the lack of support you're getting at home while you're trying to change your diet._ | _It sounds like you don’t have much support at home when it comes to changing your diet._ |
| _I know how you feel. My friends always pick restaurants with few options that fit my food preferences._  | _Your friends don’t seem to be helping you with your goals to change your diet._ |

Nonverbal communication is as important



| **Nonverbal Communication** | **Examples** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Posture | How one stands, sits, or whether arms are crossed |
| Eye contact | Making or avoiding eye contact or rolling eyes |
| Gestures | Pointing, thumbs up, large vs. subtle gestures, or nodding |
