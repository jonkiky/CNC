# Managing Plateaus and Maintaining Weight Loss

Two major **challenges** that people face include weight-loss plateaus and preventing weight regain.

## Weight-Loss Plateaus

Almost everyone experiences weight-loss plateaus in the quest to lose weight. A weight-loss **plateau** can be defined as a period of stalled progress of 1 month or longer 

Weight change is a function of **energy balance**. When people consume fewer calories than they expend, they establish an energy deficit and lose weight. If weight loss stops, it means there is no longer a deficit. Energy consumption has reached a new equilibrium with **energy expenditure.**

### Lapses in Dietary Adherence

An increase in energy intake so that energy intake matches energy expenditure is the main reason for a weight-loss plateau. Weight-loss success is strongly related to **dietary adherence** rather than diet type or macronutrient composition
