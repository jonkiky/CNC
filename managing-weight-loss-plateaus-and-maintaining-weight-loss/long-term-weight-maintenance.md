# Long-Term Weight Maintenance

Reasons for low success rates include **impaired satiety signals** \(Cornier, Grunwald, Johnson, & Bessesen, 2004\), increased **biological drive to regain weight** \(Polidori, Sanghvi, Seeley, & Hall, 2016\), **hyperpalatable food environment,** **constant food cues** and easy access \(Morris, Beilharz, Maniam, Reichelt, & Westbrook, 2015\), **long-term reductions in physical activity energy expenditure** \(Rosenbaum, Hirsch, Gallagher, & Leibel, 2008\), and **experiences of higher burden because maintaining weight loss** requires much more effort compared to lean people \(Kruseman, Schmutz, & Carrard, 2017\).Impaired Satiety Signals.

### Factors Associated With Regain

**Sedentary lifestyle:** Randomized controlled trials \(RCTs\) show that weight regain is more likely when physical activity energy expenditure is low

**Disinhibited eating:** People that tend to have no restraint regarding their eating habits are more likely to regain weight

**Dichotomous view of foods and a rigid approach to dieting:** Rigid approaches are an all-or-nothing approach to dieting and allow for very little flexibility. 

**Binge eating:** Binge eating includes the consumption of large quantities of food while feeling a lack of control over eating. 

**Emotional eating, psychosocial stress, and low coping capacity**

**Lack of social support**

**Psychopathology:** Depression or other psychiatric diagnoses may be associated with regain risk, although the research findings have not been consistent

**Medication-induced appetite elevation:** Some medications may increase appetite and lead to weight regain. 

**Excessive loss of fat-free mass:** The percentage of weight loss from fat-free mass during a diet is a predictor of subsequent weight regain

**Diet burnout:** Long-term weight maintenance takes increased effort

#### Weight-Cycling History

A previous history of **weight cycling** is associated with increased risk of weight regain

Previous failed attempts to maintain weight loss may alter a person’s confidence to be able to achieve long-term success.



#### Diet Breaks as an Adherence Tool

The increased biological drive to regain weight combined with the hyperpalatable, easy-to-access food environment can make long-term adherence difficult. Willpower is generally insufficient to overcome these challenges. The physiological, psychological, and environmental factors can be overwhelming. Thus, an appropriate dietary strategy for a client is one that makes adherence as easy as possible while minimizing any suffering.

 **Intermittent dietary strategies** can be a useful tool to help enhance long-term adherence. 

**Intermittent dietary strategies** Alternating periods of energy restriction with periods of maintenance or diet breaks.
