# Introduction

The setting of a goal does not guarantee its success.

Individuals must set the right kind of goals that enhance motivation, build confidence, and inspire direct attention toward goal completion.

### Goal-Setting Definitions

When defining goals, most researchers divide them into objective and subjective goals. **Objective goals** focus on “attaining a specific standard of proficiency on a task, usually within a specified time”

**subjective goals** are general statements \(“I want to lead a healthier lifestyle”\) that are vague and not easily measurable. 



Example Objective and Subjective Goals

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left">Objective Goals</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">
        <p>I want to lose 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) in 8 weeks.</p>
        <p>I want to reduce daily caloric intake by 500 calories.</p>
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">Subjective Goals</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>I want to look and feel better.</p>
        <p>I want to eat more vegetables.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>



### Types of Goals

Goals can be divided into three different types.

First are **outcome goals**, which are goals usually focused on the end result and oftentimes in relation to another person in the form of competition. 

econd are **performance goals**, which are goals in relation to one’s own level of performance or behavior.

Finally, there are **process goals**, which are goals focused on helping individuals reach their performance goal. 



In terms of the relationship among these three types of goals, it appears most **effective** if individuals **focus on performance and process goals** and use outcome goals where appropriate

      <th style="text-align:left">Examples</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">Outcome Goal</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <ol>
          <li>Win a weight loss competition among friends.</li>
          <li>Place in top ten in a 5K race.</li>

      <td style="text-align:left">
        <ol>
          <li>Reduce calorie intake from 3,000 to 2,000 calories.</li>
          <li>Perform aerobic exercise for 1 hour per day 5 days per week.</li>
        </ol>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">Process Goal</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <ol>
          <li>Avoid buying processed snack foods at the grocery store.</li>
          <li>Schedule 1-hour workouts at 6:30 a.m. Monday&#x2013;Friday.</li>
        </ol>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>



### Goal-Setting Effectiveness

 **goal specificity** \(do your best vs. specific goals\), **goal proximity** \(short vs. long-term goals\), **goal difficulty** \(hard, moderate, and easy goals\), **goal commitment** \(how important it is to reach one’s goal\), and **goal type** \(outcome, performance, and process goals\). 

goal-setting intervention： The process included recognizing a need for change, establishing goals, adopting a goal-directed activity and **self-monitoring** it, and self-rewarding goal attainment. 

In another study, Nothwehr and Yang \(2007\) found that individuals who **more frequently set goals related** to diet and nutrition used more appropriate behavioral strategies for weight management and diet and nutrition.



Examples of Specific vs. Vague Goals

| **Vague Goals** | **Specific Goals** |
| :--- | :--- |
| My goal is to decrease my caloric intake. | My goal is to reduce my caloric intake from 2,500 to 2,000 calories per day. |
| My goal is to increase the amount of fruits and vegetables I eat each day. | My goal is to increase my fruit and vegetable intake from one serving to two servings per day. |
| My goal is to increase my exercise frequency and intensity. | My goal is to exercise 4 days a week for 1 hour, which includes 10-minutes of stretching, 30 minutes of jogging, and 20 minutes of strength training. |

### Why Goals Work



1. Directing attention and action
2. Mobilizing effort
3. Enhancing persistence
4. Developing new learning strategies
