# Goal-Setting Principles



An updated version is known as SMARTS goals. Looking at each letter, SMARTS goals principles are as follows:

* S - Specific
* M - Measurable
* A - Action-Oriented
* R - Realistic
* T - Timely
* S - Self-Determined

### Specific and Measurable Goals

Goal specificity allows individuals to adequately and properly assess whether or not they are making progress toward achieving their goal.

Individuals who use **action plan**s more often and more systematically achieve their goals. Action plans also help overcome barriers that may get in the way of achieving a specific goal.

### Realistic \(But Challenging\) Goals

Setting realistic goals is a key component of an effective goal-setting strategy. 

### Timely Goals

All goals should have a specific timeframe in which they should be accomplished.

Long-term goals provide direction and set the stage for what a client is eventually trying to achieve.

Short-term goals are important because they help individuals focus on small improvements and provide continuous feedback concerning progress toward the long-term goal.

A good way to envision the interaction of short-term and long-term goals is to think of a staircase with the long-term goal at the top, the present level of performance \(behavior\) at the bottom, and a sequence of progressively linked short-term goals connecting the top and the bottom steps.



### Self-Determined Goals

require that clients be committed to those goals.

One important way to enhance commitment is to have clients take an active part in setting their goals. Goals that are self-determined will provide longer-lasting **intrinsic motivation**

When Nutrition Coaches are working with clients to set goals, they should elicit the client's opinion about realistic goals and provide rationales for specific goal choices.



### Reevaluate Goals

 **A**sk the client what is getting in the way of achieving their goal and reevaluate whether the goal was ever feasible.

### Goal Feedback

In addition to periodically reevaluating clients’ goals, it is also important to provide feedback on a regular basis regarding their progress.

feedback also includes general statements such as “You’re doing well,” “Keep up the good work,” “You need to spend more time on your goals,” and “Hang in there.” These qualitative statements should be included along with more specific quantitative feedback



### Individualize Goals

make sure that Nutrition Coaches customize goals to the individual
